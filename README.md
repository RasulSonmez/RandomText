# Random Text with c# .net core
In this application, there is an input and a button on the web page. The user can write numbers to this input.
Every time the user enters a number into the input and presses the send button, 100 random texts with the length of the number entered by the user are created and saved to the db.
The texts saved in the db are listed in a table on one page.
While listing these texts, the following manipulation is done:
 Next to the letter in each text, the number of times that letter appears in that text is written next to the letter. example: "xnixw" => "x2n1i1w1".
There is also sorting and search in the table.
